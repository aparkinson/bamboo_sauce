- The Bamboo plugin is configured by the src/main/resources/atlassian-plugin.xml file which defines
the entry points into the plugin.  Further information on the available entry points to Bamboo plugins
can be found at http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Bamboo+Development+Hub

The plugin currently uses the following entry points:

 - Pre Build Action (com.saucelabs.bamboo.sod.action.BuildConfigurator) - invoked before a build is launched
 - Pre Build Queued Action (com.saucelabs.bamboo.sod.action.EnvironmentConfigurator) - invoked when the build is queued (ie. the first action that is run when a build is triggered)
 - Build Processor (com.saucelabs.bamboo.sod.action.SSHTunnelCloser) - Run after a build has completed (run on a build agent if agents are used)
 - Build Processor Server (com.saucelabs.bamboo.sod.action.PostBuildAction) - Run on the Bamboo server after a build has completed
  
- Two Maven pom files are specified: pom.xml and pom_old.xml. The pom_old.xml is configured to use an 
older version of the Atlassian Plugin SDK, and the pom.xml file is used to use the latest version of the 
Atlassian Plugin SDK.  Jars built with the pom.xml file package the dependancies in a META-INF/lib directory
within the jar file, however it doesn't look like that Bamboo can load these dependencies into it's class
loader. However, the latest version of the Atlassian Plugin SDK allows us to run and debug an instance
of Bamboo with the plugin installed by invoking 'atlas-mvn debug'.

Jars built with the pom_old.xml file extract the dependency contents into the jar itself which works okay
with Bamboo.  Hence, we keep dependencies in both pom.xml and pom_old.xml in sync.

- To build a new Jar of the plugin, run the following command:

    atlas-mvn -f pom_old.xml clean package

- The plugin includes a dependency on Jython 2.5.0.  Although the plugin does not directly require Jython, it
is required for the Sauce Connect 2 library, and the dependency is included here due to issues with Jython 
inner classes not being included in the Sauce Connect 2 jar file. 

- To build and deploy a new version of the plugin:
 
    - Update the 'ci.version' property in the pom.xml and pom_old.xml file to reference the new version
    - Run atlas-mvn -f pom_old.xml clean package
    - Attach the jar to the https://studio.plugins.atlassian.com/wiki/display/BSAD/Sauce+OnDemand page
    - Update the https://studio.plugins.atlassian.com/wiki/display/BSAD/Sauce+OnDemand page to include 
      details of the new version
    - Update https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/30134 to include the details of the new version
