- Common logic used by both the Jenkins and Bamboo plugins has been extracted into a separate project.  The source is available from scm:git:git@github.com:saucelabs/ci-sauce.git, and the Jar file has been deployed to the Cloudbees repository.

- The Bamboo plugin is configured by the src/main/resources/atlassian-plugin.xml file which defines
the entry points into the plugin.  Further information on the available entry points to Bamboo plugins
can be found at http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Bamboo+Development+Hub

The plugin currently uses the following entry points:

 - Pre Build Action (com.saucelabs.bamboo.sod.action.BuildConfigurator) - invoked before a build is launched
 - Pre Build Queued Action (com.saucelabs.bamboo.sod.action.EnvironmentConfigurator) - invoked when the build is queued (ie. the first action that is run when a build is triggered)
 - Build Processor (com.saucelabs.bamboo.sod.action.SSHTunnelCloser) - Run after a build has completed (run on a build agent if agents are used)
 - Build Processor Server (com.saucelabs.bamboo.sod.action.PostBuildAction) - Run on the Bamboo server after a build has completed
  
- Two Maven pom files are specified: pom.xml and pom_old.xml. The pom_old.xml is configured to use an older version of the Atlassian Plugin SDK, and the pom.xml file is used to use the latest version of the Atlassian Plugin SDK.  The pom_old.xml file is currently used by the Jenkins builds (running on https://saucelabs.ci.cloudbees.com), as the Jenkins instance throws an Exception when parsing the test results when using the pom.xml file.

- To build a new Jar of the plugin, run the following command:

    atlas-mvn -f pom_old.xml clean package

- To build and deploy a new version of the plugin, you will need to modify your Maven settings.xml file to include the username/password for the Sauce Labs CloudBees instance (https://cloudbees.zendesk.com/entries/421064-maven-guide), then:

    - Run atlas-mvn release:prepare.  You will be prompted to enter the version to be released, the tag to be applied, and the next version number (ending with SNAPSHOT)
    - Run atlas-mvn release:perform.  This will upload a copy of the jar file to https://repository-saucelabs.forge.cloudbees.com/release
    - Update the https://studio.plugins.atlassian.com/wiki/display/BSAD/Sauce+OnDemand page to include 
      details of the new version
    - Update https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/30134 to include the details of the new version
